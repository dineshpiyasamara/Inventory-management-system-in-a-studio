# Inventory management system in a studio

The inventory in a studio should be updated frequently. So, this system has been developed to manage inventory and manage records in a studio using selling details, purchases details, customer details, supplier details, and details of users.
The main scope of this project is to save time and avoid some mistakes when recording purchases, selling items, and other services in a studio. I try to develop a pre-defined way to manage inventory through the system. It will be easy to maintain a competent and favorable procedure in a studio through this system.
